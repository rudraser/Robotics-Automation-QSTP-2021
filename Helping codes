Creating a workspace for catkin
Let's create and build a catkin workspace:

$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make




Creating a ROS Package
For a package to be considered a catkin package it must meet a few requirements:

   1. The package must contain a catkin compliant package.xml file.
        :That package.xml file provides meta information about the package. 

   2. The package must contain a CMakeLists.txt which uses catkin.

        :If it is a catkin metapackage it must have the relevant boilerplate CMakeLists.txt file. 
   3. Each package must have its own folder
        
        :This means no nested packages nor multiple packages sharing the same directory. 
        
        


Creating a catkin Package
 
This tutorial will demonstrate how to use the catkin_create_pkg script to create a new catkin package, and what you can do with it after it has been created.

First change to the source space directory of the catkin workspace you created in the Creating a Workspace for catkin tutorial:

# You should have created this in the Creating a Workspace Tutorial
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src

Now use the catkin_create_pkg script to create a new package called 'beginner_tutorials' which depends on std_msgs, roscpp, and rospy:

$ catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp

This will create a beginner_tutorials folder which contains a package.xml and a CMakeLists.txt, which have been partially filled out with the information you gave catkin_create_pkg.

catkin_create_pkg requires that you give it a package_name and optionally a list of dependencies on which that package depends:

# This is an example, do not try to run this
# catkin_create_pkg <package_name> [depend1] [depend2] [depend3]





Building a catkin workspace and sourcing the setup file
Now you need to build the packages in the catkin workspace:

$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make

After the workspace has been built it has created a similar structure in the devel subfolder as you usually find under /opt/ros/$ROSDISTRO_NAME.

To add the workspace to your ROS environment you need to source the generated setup file:

$ . ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
